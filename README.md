tictactoe
=========

A simple python console application. A Tic-Tac-Toe game with unbeatable ai.

## Minimax Algorithm

The minimax algorithm is a decision rule used for two-player game. The concept of minimax algorithm is to simulate all posible move of both players and then make the best decision.

Reference from [Tic Tac Toe: Understanding The Minimax Algorithm](http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax)

## Description

This project is to learn the minimax algorithm by implememnting the algorithm to a simple tictactoe game. It is because the maximum cases/situation of tictactoe is countable and computable in short time. Therefore, no other condition/advanced algorithm is needed, such as the alpha-beta pruning which is implemented in the [connec-4 project](https://github.com/prgerLeo/connect-4).

## How to play

Run the main.py file `python main.py` and start playing the tictactoe. Before you run the python script, you need to install the python environment.
